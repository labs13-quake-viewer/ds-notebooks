**Below the graphs:**

The graphs here give us some idea of the relationship between the damage caused by an earthquake that generates a tsunami, and one that doesn't. We can see only so much in the graphs. So, in addition to the graphs, below are some t-tests and p-values for each of the categories in the graphs above.

**Insert t-tests here**
T-Tests.png

The first t-test shows a relationship between deaths caused by an earthquakes that generated tsunamis and earthquakes that did not. The p-value does not suggest a significant relationship but one that nonetheless should be explored further.

Below that is a t-test that shows a significant relationship between injuries and tsuanmi occurrances as a result of an earthquake. The third addresses individuals reported missing. Next is the cost of damage incurred. Fifth is the number of houses destroyed and the last, the number of houses damaged. 

In all but the first test, the p-value is considerably significant indicating a strong relationship. Tsunamis cause substantially more damage than an earthquake event without a tsunami being generated. Exploring this further is a necessity to minimize the impact an earthquake with a tsunami event would have.
